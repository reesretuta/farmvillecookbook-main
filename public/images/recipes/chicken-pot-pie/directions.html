<h6>Directions</h6>
<ol>
<li>Pre-heat oven to 350° F.</li>
<li>Put chicken, onion, celery, carrot, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme into a stockpot. Add just enough water to cover all the ingredients, then simmer on medium heat for 20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked all the way through. Pull chicken from the broth, strain, and save the liquid.</li>
<li>Wait until chicken has cooled, dice into 1-inch pieces.</li>
<li>In a separate pot, boil water and blanch carrots, potatoes, and peas until they are almost cooked through. Set filling aside.</li>
<li>Cook bacon in a large pan, remove once crispy. Using the same pan with bacon fat, add butter and sauté onions and garlic until translucent, season with salt and black pepper. Add flour and stir until a paste forms, about 1 minute. </li>
<li>While slowly stirring, add milk, making sure there are no lumps. Then add your saved chicken broth; continuously stir sauce until it thickens.  Add more milk if it becomes too thick. Add additional salt to taste.</li>
<li>Add blanched vegetables, bacon, and herbs to the mixture and transfer everything into a casserole dish.</li>
<li>Mix one egg and ½ cup of water.</li>
<li>With a brush, apply egg wash around the edge of the casserole dish.</li>
<li>Take your thawed puff pastry and fold it over the casserole dish, making sure everything is sealed around the edges. Brush the entire puff pastry with remaining egg wash.</li>
<li>Bake for 25 minutes, or until the puff pastry is golden brown.</li>
