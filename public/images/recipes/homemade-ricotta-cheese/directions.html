<h6>Directions</h6>
<ol>
<li>Add milk and salt to a medium thick-bottomed pan and gently bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Stir occasionally until it begins to boil, then turn off the heat and add lemon juice.</li>
<li>Stir a few times and allow it to fully curdle – it takes about a minute.</li>
<li>Lay the cheesecloth in a fine strainer over a bowl.</li>
<li>Pour the mixture over the cheesecloth and let it drain for a few minutes. The longer it drains, the drier it will be. Let it drain for about 10 - 20 minutes for a moister cheese.</li>
<li>Drizzle with honey and serve with crackers or fresh sliced fruit or add to favorite pastas or lasagnas. </li>
