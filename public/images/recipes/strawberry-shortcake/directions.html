<h6>Directions</h6>

<h5>Shortcake:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350º F. Prepare three 9-inch round cake pans with nonstick baking spray or coated well with shortening or butter and flour, taking care to remove all excess flour.</li>
<li>Cream together butter and shortening until light and fluffy with an electric mixer. Slowly add sugar one cup at a time, making sure to fully incorporate each cup before adding another. Add eggs one at a time, making sure to fully incorporate each egg before adding another. Add in lemon zest.</li>
<li>Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Pour milks and vanilla into measuring cup and whisk together with a fork. Add to butter and shortening mixture alternately with milk mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Gently stir all ingredients until well combined. Stop mixer and scrape down sides and bottom of bowl, making sure to have all ingredients mixed well.</li>
<li>Evenly distribute cake batter between lined cupcake pans. Bake about 17 minutes or until tester comes out clean.</li>

<h5>Icing:</h5>

<li>Add the room temperature softened butter and the shortening and place it in a Kitchen Aid (with paddle attachment). Whip until smooth and creamy. Slowly add a cup of the powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon of the vanilla. Continue to whip until desired consistency is reached, adding more sugar as needed. Scoop out of the mixer and place in a large bowl.</li>
<li>Clean bowl and return the Kitchen Aid bowl to the mixer and attach the whipping attachment. Pour in the heavy whipping cream, the vanilla and ¼ cup of the powdered sugar. Whip on high until peaks are formed. Move the whipped cream to the bowl with the buttercream, and very gently fold the whipped cream into the buttercream.</li>

<li>If you don't have a piping bag, transfer the frosting to a gallon Ziploc bag. Cut a corner off and frost the cooled cupcakes.</li>
