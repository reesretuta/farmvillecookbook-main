<h6>Directions</h6>

<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350° F. </li>
<li>Drop peaches into a saucepan of boiling water for 15 - 30 seconds. </li>
<li>Remove with a skimmer and rinse under cold running water. Rub off skins and slice the peaches about ¼ inch thick. You should have about 3 cups.</li>
<li>Place a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the butter, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg and ¼ cup of the sugar. Stir as the butter and sugar melt. </li>
<li>Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the syrup boils and thickens slightly, 2 - 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
<li>Carefully arrange the peach slices in a decorative pattern, working from the outer edge to the center. Set aside.</li>
<li>To make the batter, place the cream and vanilla in a mixing bowl and whip on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. </li>
<li>Gradually beat in the remaining 1 cup of sugar in a steady stream and continue mixing until soft, do not over-mix. </li>
<li>Add the eggs and beat until soft peaks form again. </li>
<li>Sift the flour and salt over the top of the batter and fold in until evenly mixed. </li>
<li>Gently pour the batter over the peaches in the skillet, spreading it evenly.</li>
<li>Place the skillet in the oven with a baking sheet placed on the shelf below to catch any drips. </li>
<li>Bake for about 40 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. </li>
<li>Let the cake stand for 5 - 10 minutes. Place a heatproof serving dish on top and carefully invert so that the cake drops straight down over the center of your dish. </li>
<li>To serve, use a serrated knife to cut through the peaches and the cake. This is best served warm from the oven.</li>
