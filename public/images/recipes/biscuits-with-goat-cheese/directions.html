<h6>Directions</h6>

<h5>Goat Cheese: </h5>
<ol>
<li>In a non-reactive pot, heat the goat milk slowly on the stove over low heat until it reaches about 180º F - 185º F. You should see gentle bubbles and the surface will start to look a bit foamy. Turn off and remove from heat.</li>
<li>Stir in the lemon juice and let sit for 10 minutes. The milk should curdle and start to become a bit thicker on the surface.</li>
<li>Line a colander with two layers of cheesecloth and very gently pour the milk-lemon mixture into the lined colander. Gather the cheesecloth up around the curds and tie into a bundle, using kitchen twine or a rubber band.</li>
<li>Set the colander over a large bowl, pot, or jar, so the liquid (the whey) can drip out. Let drain for at least 1 ½ hours or overnight.</li>
<li>Scrape the goat cheese off the cheesecloth and into a small bowl or airtight container (if not ready to use right away) with a spoon.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Blueberry Compote:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Combine 1 cup of blueberries with 3 tablespoons water, lemon juice, and sugar in a small saucepan.</li>
<li>Cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes, and then mash mixture with a potato masher until fairly smooth.</li>
<li>Add remaining ½ cup blueberries.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, combine arrowroot (or cornstarch) and 1 teaspoon of water and stir until completely smooth.</li>
<li>Pour into blueberry mixture and raise the heat until compote reaches a gentle boil</li>
<li>Boil for about 1 minute, or until lightly thickened. Mash again until desired texture is reached.</li>
<li>Set aside.</li>
</ol>


<h5>Biscuits:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 450ºF.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, combine all dry biscuit ingredients. Then, using a pastry blender, two knives or a food processor, cut butter into the flour until it resembles course meal.</li>
<li>Add buttermilk and mix until just combined. Over-stirring will result in tough biscuits.</li>
<li>Turn out biscuit dough onto flour surface. Pat dough down until it's ½ inch thick, then fold dough about five times (using a dough scraper really helps!). Finally, pat down until about 1 inch thick.</li>
<li>Cut into rounds using a round cookie cutter or mold. Place biscuits on a cookie sheet and bake for 10 – 12 minutes, or until biscuits are a light golden brown on top.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Assemble Biscuits:</h5> 
<ol>
<li>Slice warm biscuits in half and spread homemade goat cheese over the bottom half. Top with blueberry compote and serve.</li>
