<h6>Directions</h6>
<ol>

<li>Stir together sugar, crushed strawberries, balsamic vinegar, calcium water, and lemon juice in a large mixing bowl. </li>
<li>Add sprigs of thyme to water and bring to a boil. </li>
<li>Strain and measure ¾ cup into a blender carafe. </li>
<li>Sprinkle the pectin powder over the boiling water in the blender and add the lid. </li>
<li>Open the vent on the blender lid, cover with a doubled dish towel or wash cloth, and blend on high for 1 - 2 minutes or until the pectin powder is completely dissolved.</li>
<li>Scrape into the berry mixture and stir well.</li>
<li>Pour the pectin water into the berry mixture and stir very well to combine. It should start to gel visibly. If it does not gel (although the gel will be much more soft-set than cooked jam), add 1 teaspoon of calcium water and blend well, repeating if necessary.</li>
<li>Ladle into prepared containers to within ½ inch of the rims, fix the lids on tightly and freeze for later use.</li>
