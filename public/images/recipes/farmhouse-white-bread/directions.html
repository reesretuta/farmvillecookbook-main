<h5>Mixing and Fermentation (first rise):</h5>
<ol>
<li>In a very large bowl, use a wooden or heavy plastic spoon to stir together the all-purpose flour, yeast, and sugar. </li>
<li>Make a small well in the middle of the flour mixture and pour in the oil and the milk. Mix well.</li>
<li>Slowly add 1 cup of bread flour at a time and stir it in until you've added 3 - 4 cups of the mixture. Dough will be sticky and shaggy; this should take a few minutes. </li>
<li>Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel (not something fuzzy like terrycloth) and let it rest for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the salt and 1 more cup of bread flour and stir it in as best you can. Add another cup of bread flour if the dough is still too sticky to knead.</li>
<li>Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead it with floured hands until the dough is soft and smooth, about 8 - 10 minutes.</li>
<li>As you're kneading, sprinkle a little more flour at a time as needed to keep the dough from sticking to your hands or the work surface. You want it to be as soft as possible without being sticky; you may not need the entire six cups of bread flour, or you may need a little extra.</li>
<li>Place the kneaded dough in a large straight sided, food grade plastic container with a snap-on lid. There's no need to grease or flour the container. Use a felt tip pen or piece of masking tape to mark the spot on the container that the dough will reach when it has doubled in volume.</li>
<li>Set the dough somewhere that is preferably between 70°F and 75°F until it has doubled in size, about 60 - 75 minutes. It's fine if the temperature is cooler; it'll just take your dough a little longer to rise and will end up even tastier. On hot days I use cold milk to make my bread dough, and on cold days I heat the milk to about 100°F.</li>


</ol>


<h5>Shaping and Proofing (second rise):</h5>

<ol>
<li>Turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, flattening gently with your hands to break up any large air bubbles. Divide the dough into three equal pieces.</li>
<li>If you're using a baking stone, put the stone into the oven and heat to 375° F. </li>
<li>Shape the dough into Pullman loaves.</li>
<li>Place the loaves seam side down in greased loaf pans and dust them liberally with flour. Cover the loaves with a damp tea towel and let them rise until the dough springs back just a little when you gently poke it with a floured finger, about 40 - 60 minutes.</li>
<li>Bake at 375° F for 35 minutes, or until the loaves are golden brown and the bottoms sound hollow if tapped (you need to carefully remove a loaf from the pan to check this). Remove the loaves immediately from the pans and let them cool on a wire rack.</li>
<li>The bread will continue to bake inside while it's cooling, so try to wait at least 40 minutes before cutting into a loaf.</li>
<li>Store at room temperature or freeze in zipper freezer bags. Make sure the loaves are completely cooled before sealing in bags.</li>
