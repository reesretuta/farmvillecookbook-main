<h6>Directions</h6>


<ol>
<li>Combine 1 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon for the topping. Set aside.</li>
<li>In a pot, bring milk and butter to a boil. Then add flour, yeast, sugar and salt.</li>
<li>Stir together to create a smooth paste. Then remove from heat.</li>
<li>Peel apples and cut them into 1-centimeter small cubes.  Add the lemon juice and zest to eliminate browning.</li>
<li>Using a mixer with a hook, mix apple pieces into the dough.</li>
<li>Once apples are mixed in, add eggs one at a time.</li>
<li>Let the dough rest for 20 - 30 minutes to allow the yeast to develop.</li>
<li>Finally, the dough should be smooth. For a rustic look, form small dumplings with a tablespoon and fry them in hot oil. Do not crowd in the pot since the crullers will expand in the oil. For a more polished look, use a piping bag with a piping star nozzle tip (size 12), pipe dough into rings onto parchment paper. Place in the freezer for 20 minutes to make it easier to transfer to fry oil.</li>
<li>Once fried, remove from oil and let cool for 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Roll, toss and sprinkle the crullers in the sugar and cinnamon mixture. They are tastiest when served while hot.</li>
