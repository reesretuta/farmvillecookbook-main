<h6>Directions</h6>

<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 400° F.</li>
<li>Spread the pumpkin on a baking sheet and toss with one tablespoon of the oil. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Bake until tender, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.</li>
<li>Bring the broth to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Turn off the heat but leave the saucepan on the stove.</li>
<li>Heat oil in a large heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sweat until translucent about 2 - 3 minutes. Add rice and cook for 2 minutes, stirring often, until it turns from translucent to opaque. </li>
<li>Next, pour the wine into the pot and cook until evaporated. Add one cup of the chicken stock, stirring constantly, until the rice absorbs almost all of the broth, about 3 minutes. </li>
<li>Repeat, keeping the risotto at a steady simmer and adding more broth as it is absorbed, until you use all the broth and the rice is barely tender, about 20 minutes total.</li>
<li>Melt butter and add the pumpkin, cook until heated through about 1 minute. </li>
<li>Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese. Season to taste with the salt and pepper. Sprinkle with walnuts and serve.  </li>
