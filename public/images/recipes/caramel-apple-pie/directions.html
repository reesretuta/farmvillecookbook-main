<h6>Directions</h6>


<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 375° F.</li>
<li>Lay one pie crust across the bottom of a 9 inch pie pan and press gently into the sides and bottom. There should be about ½ inch overhang on all sides.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, combine apple slices, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, allspice and vanilla extract. Toss with your hands to coat evenly.</li>
<li>Add 15 caramels to the apple mixture and toss to distribute.</li>
<li>Pour apple filling into the pie pan.</li>
<li>Cover with the second pie crust, tucking together and fluting the edges.</li>
<li>Cut slits into the top of the pie crust for ventilation. Cover the edge of the pie with foil or a silicone pastry protector.</li>
<li>Bake for 25 minutes, then remove foil or protector, and bake for another 30-35 minutes, until crust is golden.</li>
<li>Allow to cool completely. Then melt 5 caramels and tablespoon of cream or half and half in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat for 30 seconds at a time, for about a minute and a half, stirring after each time.</li>
<li>When the caramel is melted to a smooth consistency, use a spoon to spread it over the top of the pie crust. You can make designs or just cover it completely – this is up to you.</li>
<li>Allow to cool – the caramel will harden. Serve immediately, or cover with foil and serve within 3 days.</li>
